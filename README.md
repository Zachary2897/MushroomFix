# MushroomFix
[MushroomFix](https://zachary2897.com/mushroomfix) is an old mod that I created back in 2018 which renames the “Mushroom” items and blocks to “Brown Mushroom” and “Red Mushroom” for each type respectively. It also allows resource packs to change these names independently of each other.

Since this mod hasn't been maintained since early 2019, I am releasing the original source code under the terms of the MIT License. Do with it what you will.
